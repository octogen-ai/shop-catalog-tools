# Octogen Shop Catalog Tools

This repository contains tools to download and work with the Octogen shopping catalogs. The instructions here have been tested on MacOS, but
not on Windows.

## Getting Started

### 1.A Install UV

Please follow instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for your platform.


### 1.B Install Duckdb 

```
brew install duckdb
```

### 2. Setup environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following env vars.
Please obtain the customer name and service account credentials file from your Octogen Account rep.

```
OCTOGEN_CATALOG_BUCKET_NAME=octogen-catalog-exchange
OCTOGEN_CUSTOMER_NAME=<octogen-customer-name>
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<Path to the Service Account credentials file>
```

### 3. Process the catalog

You have two options to process a catalog:

#### Option A: Single Command (Recommended)
Run all steps (download, load to database, and index) with a single command:
```bash
uv run src/process_catalog.py --catalog anntaylor
uv run src/process_catalog.py --catalog heydude
uv run src/process_catalog.py --catalog chairish
```

This will:
1. Download the catalog to `/tmp/octogen-catalog-exchange`
2. Create a Duckdb database named `anntaylor_catalog.duckdb` 
3. Create a Whoosh index at `/tmp/whoosh/anntaylor`

You can customize any of these paths:
```bash
uv run src/process_catalog.py --catalog anntaylor --download /custom/path --index_dir /custom/index/path
```

#### Option B: Individual Steps
Alternatively, you can run each step individually:

1. Download the catalog:
```bash
uv run src/octogen_catalog.py --catalog anntaylor --download /tmp/octogen-catalog-exchange
```

2. Extract the data to a database:
```bash
uv run src/load_to_db.py --catalog anntaylor --download /tmp/octogen-catalog-exchange
```

3. Index the data:
```bash
uv run src/index_catalog.py --table_name anntaylor
```

### 8. Run a sample UI! 

I've included a sample UI in `src/app/src/App.svelte`. To run it, you can use the following command.

First, you will need to make sure you have installed `npm`: 
```
brew install npm
```

Then run the shell script, which will install all dependencies and start the FastAPI server and the Svelte server:

```
chmod +x run_api_and_svelte_server.sh
./run_api_and_svelte_server.sh
```

This should output something like:
```
  VITE v5.4.11  ready in 293 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
INFO:     127.0.0.1:53403 - "GET /api/anntaylor/products?page=1&per_page=100 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```
Open up your browser and go to the URL generated by the script, e.g. `http://localhost:5173/`. You should see a list of products. You can click on the product to see variants
etc.
